    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <h1>WIRED AMERICA</h1>
    <h3>
    It is difficult to pin down exactly when a social or technological revolution begins. Some historians assume that the Industrial Revolution took place entirely within the 1800s, while others contend it started a hundred years earlier and did not end until the 1930s. I predict that future historians will have the same issue defining the Information Age that we are now living through. Did it start in World War Two, with the first sophisticated applications of digital technology, or in the early 1990s, when the Internet first became popular? Obviously, this classification is a largely subjective matter for debate. In both ages, however, there was a defining moment when innovators invented products that would finally bring the full promise of new technologies into the lives of everyday Americans. The final realization of the industrial revolution in that context, I would argue, was the introduction of electric light and appliances to the home. Similarly, today the introduction of digital connectivity in the home with computers and the Internet represents the cumulative result of decades technological revolt that has been brewing for the past half century.
    <p>
    These two popular revolutions have striking similarities. David Nye observed that soon after the adoption of electric power, is users did “not merely use electricity. Rather, the self and the electrified world intertwined.” This concept should be familiar to most Americans today, who spend hours each day producing, consuming, and communicating through cyberspace.
    <p>
    This paper does not compare the aftermath of these technologies. To do so would be premature. Instead, it compares the construction and adoption of electrical infrastructure from 1890 to 1940 to that of networked computer technology from 1950 to today. This paper is not a comprehensive history of the technologies, but instead a series of observations on social, economic, and legal similarities.
    <p>
    The fundamental argument this paper makes is that the Information Revolution is not unprecedented in American history. We forget that just a few short generations ago, a similar transformation took place. The adoption of digital technology in the home is  in many ways analogous to the adoption of domestic electrical technology in the twentieth century.
    <p>
    Until the invention of the lightbulb and the electrical network, the effect of the previous centuries technological progress on the daily lives of most Americans was relatively superficial. The same can be said of the personal computer and the internet. As this paper will argue, we can use our own experience with the information age to contextualize the electrical revolution. More importantly, the legal, social, and economic upheaval that came with electrical networks can help educate how we approach analogue issues of the Information Age.

      <h2>Rhetoric v. Reality</h2>
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h3>
        Both the Electrical Revolution and the Information Age heralded progressive social and economic changes. While change is always inevitable with such massive breakthroughs, many observers and pundits would attempt to guide society in its embrace of new technologies. By examining the rhetoric that became common surrounding electrification in the early 20th century, we can better understand that which even today frames our perception of the Information Age.
      <p>
        Large corporations have been key in directing the narrative of technological change in both the Electrical Revolution and the Information Age. Sometimes this is for competitive reasons, as described in Part One, in which companies use World’s Fairs as venues to publicly best their corporate adversaries. However, just as often large conglomerates have used their considerable marketing power in order to attain political ends, as described in Part Three.
      <p>
        The narrative of technology is influenced by the ideology of the times. For example, Part Two discusses how both the Information and Electrical Revolutions resulted in dramatic changes to the organization of American households and families, and the efforts of various political movements in attempting to control the trajectory of that change. Finally, Part Four observes the “Neo-Jeffersonian” tendency that first came into vogue with the Electrical Revolution, when politicians espoused the potential electrification had to restore rural power, and again with the Information Revolution, when many pundits predicted that network technology would enable a back-to-the-land movement.
      <p>
        One common theme which emerged through the research for this chapter was how thoroughly our perceptions of the future are shaded by our experiences of the past; new technologies often seem to embed traditional values deeper within society rather than drive social progress. This is most apparent in Part Two, in which fantasy visions of “The Home of the Future” thoroughly embrace the most traditional family values, gender roles, and lifestyles instead of driving social innovation. This irony also shines in Part Four, in which rural communities hope the technology of the future will resurrect a Jeffersonian ideal of the past.
      <p>
        In retrospect, some of the rhetoric will seem absurd, some idealistic, and some blatantly political and opportunistic. This chapter will explore how public perceptions of a coming era were manufactured to meet the needs of different communities, and how the claims of the 19th century would mirror those of the 20th.

      <h2>World's Fair</h2>
      <h1>Part One</h1>
      <h3>
      <p>
      Both the old trusts of the electrical industry of the late 19th century and the ascendant companies driving the Information Age today should be noted for the disciplined and comprehensive marketing strategies they employed. Often, the most pure form of a corporate vision would manifest itself in large public gatherings like the World’s Fairs, which were popular in America from the birth of the Electrical Revolution until the first tremors of the Information Age. These events offered companies a place to demonstrate their latest technologies, and more importantly to present a platform from which to grandstand their visions for the future.
      <p>
      Throughout the late 19th and much of the 20th century, the most prestigious displays of electric light happened in demonstrations presented at the World’s Fairs. Though often patronized by corporate sponsors and deeply subsidized by government, these were not simply demonstrations of national prestige or commercial and cultural power. As historian Jill Jonnes put it, “The stakes were not immediately about money, but about the unparalleled opportunity to display to an unsuspecting world for six months the true glories and possibilities of electricity”. At a time when the harsh Dickensian reality of the industrial revolution was entering social consciousness, governments were eager to invest in ambitious, if unprofitable displays of electrical technology. As historian David Nye explains:
      <p>
      They helped to impose a middle-class progressive order on the world, and they helped to give the visitor an explanatory blueprint of social existence… providing a vision of order during a convulsive period characterized by political corruption, violent strikes, and rapid industrialization.
      <p>
      The optimistic spirit of the World’s Fairs made them popular arenas for large corporations to manage public relations and pitch new products. In order to help foot the bill, fairs would allow corporate sponsors to open their own dedicated pavilions. In the 1893 Columbian Expedition, General Electric and Westinghouse engaged in an acrimonious bidding war for the right to illuminate the fair’s vast campus. Both companies, though short on cash, were willing to take a loss for the privilege. The promise of good publicity would justify the loss on the competitive bid in industrialist George Westinghouse’s eyes upon his victory; “There is not much money in the work at the figures I have made, but the advertisement will be a valuable one and I want it”. When Westinghouse won, GE retaliated, installing “an eighty-foot-tall, half-ton Edison incandescent light bulb, shimmering gorgeously through five thousand laboriously installed prisms”, in addition to “A tasteful arena of palms displaying 2,500 different kinds of Edison incandescent bulbs”.
      <p>
      By 1893, GE, Westinghouse, and several regional power companies had illuminated the main promenades of several towns and industrial complexes. However, electrification was by no means common and some of the less cosmopolitan visitors to the fair would have never yet experienced electric light. Yet despite the prepubescent state of the industry, bankers had already begun to attempt to consolidate it into a handful of large trusts. General Electric, for example, had recently been maliciously pried from Thomas Edison’s control and incorporated into a larger trust led by a ruthless syndicate of banks. Despite it’s bad blood with Edison, GE was savvy enough to market “nostalgia for Edison’s historic lighting breakthrough”, a marketing coupe successful in “establishing the primacy of all Edison inventions”.
      <p>
      By the 1920s, this type of marketing was typical and even overdone, according to public relations historian Roland Marchand, “the conventional wisdom was that the way to humanize a large and distant corporation was to conjure a popular, folksy image of its leaders.” However, in the 1890s, General Electric was a pioneer in the process of systematically personifying a corporation by leveraging the popularity of its management and founders.
      <p>
      In reality, by this point Edison had been largely sidelined by his contemporaries in the field of electric light. Having failed to comprehend the advantages of alternating current, Edison had reluctantly passed the baton to more disciplined thinkers like Nicola Tesla and his corporate patron George Westinghouse. Instead Edison moved on to other fields like recorded sound and the moving image. Yet a casual observer in 1893 would likely fall for GE’s corporate subterfuge, paying little note to Westinghouse’s role in providing 30,000 AC lamps and attributing the brave new era instead to the genius of Edison’s ostensible collaboration with General Electric, as evidenced by their impressive pavilion.
      <p>
      Of course, the elaborate displays presented at these events were not simply created in acts of corporate brinksmanship between rivals GE and Westinghouse. In fact, the dazzling exhibitions had a far more substantive aim; to capture the hearts and minds of the American public in order to ensure the continuity of their broad political support This would prove a commodity as important to early conglomerates even as the commercial support that World’s Fair sponsorship also promised. Unlike the pleasure palaces of prior World’s Fairs, many of the exhibitions took on a museum like quality; dioramas of factories or scale models of industrial equipment were used to “teach” visitors about new technologies while demonstrating the host company’s electrical aptitude. This would hopefully cement the public view of the corporation as an “Institution” operating without needless regulation. As Roland Marchand further observed:
      <p>
      Relying on the persistence of republican values in American society, the industrial exhibitors of the turn of the century still sought to give visual pleasure to displays that would enable to layperson to enjoy a sense of technical competence… they would perceive the wisdom of defending business autonomy from deliberate interference.
      <p>
      In reality, the business practices of corporate giants were far from unimpeachable, regardless of their engineering skill. In 1893, for example, many of GE’s and Westinghouse’s clients were small towns aiming to boost their status by illuminating Main Streets in the image of New York’s Great White Way. Of course, little notice was paid to the fact that little public money went into Broadway; in 1890 as now, almost all the illumination in the Theatre District was provided by advertisers. “Every Business developed its own displays and advertising, creating lively but discordant streets… As early as 1903 Chicago, New York, and Boston had five times as many electric lights per inhabitant as Paris, London, or Berlin”, largely as a result of corporate America’s enthusiastic embrace of electrified billboards.
      <p>
      To some, the copious displays had become a nuisance; “As early as the 1890s some New York churches felt compelled to install electric advertising because they were being ignored”, according to David Nye’s Electrifying America. If local governors knew of such exigencies, they were undeterred. Most new municipal systems had little practical value beyond to project a vain and often misleading sheen of prosperity on small towns that were increasingly subjugated by growing urban metropolises.
      <p>
      In addition, many municipal power systems were rife with patronage, no-show jobs, and political quid-pro-quo. An audit of the chronically underperforming system bringing light to Muncie in the late 19th century found that the electrical utilities were particularly prone to mismanagement. “Hiring decisions at utilities were often based more on political patronage than engineering knowledge, and municipal utilities’ contracts were often negotiated with graft and kickbacks”. If a municipal contract with an electric light company brought any of the splendors of city life to small town Main Streets, it also brought opportunities for waste, greed, and corruption.
      <p>
      As will be discussed in Chapter Two, the nefarious antics of early electrical conglomerates would be directly involved in the establishment of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      <p>
      Of course, to see the great illuminated classical structures in Chicago that year, one would take the new innovations to represent a renaissance unadulterated by politics and blind corporate reaching. Yet displays at the Columbian Exposition were not designed to present a holistic demonstration of the ascendancy of a new and exciting age of prosperity and innovation. They were designed to cement confidence and trust in the new corporate establishment in the eyes of the public and to encourage municipalities to invest, sometimes unwisely, in their products.
      <p>
      <center>•</center>
      <p>
      Seventy-one years later, New York would hold its own World’s Fair in 1964. Like the 1893 Fair, this one would be a mecca for speculation of future technological development, and a sharp-eyed visitor might have felt tremors of the then fetal Information Age. For example, the de facto telecom monopoly, AT&T, was demonstrating its new teleconference device, the Picturephone. Slated for mass adoption by 1970, “Each Picturephone circuit needed the equivalent of a hundred voice lines, so the network would need plenty of new capacity”, which AT&T planned to meet with its experimental waveguide technology. So certain was the telecom that the picture phone would catch on that they began adding the pound sign key to telephones  that would be used to signal video calls, an archaic holdover to this day.
      <p>
      The breathless optimism of the 1964 World’s Fair echoed that of the Columbian Expedition, but similarly the atmosphere was often misleading. At some level, the promise of its glowing facades was built on a foundation of corporate politics, rather than a realistic assessment of the future. The waveguide, the missing link that could make the Picturephone practical, would never emerge from experimentation as a mainstream product, a fact that, despite billions in research spending, some of the savviest engineers already knew in 1964. The technology had become something of a Rube Goldberg device, evolving to incorporate thousands of focusing lenses, light amplifiers, and technical work arounds, rendering it expensive and impractical. Yet other more promising technologies like radio, satellite, and glass optical technologies were sidelined as AT&T hyped waveguides. Despite these problems, according to optical technology trade journalist historian Jeffery Hecht, “Thanks to regulations that assured the company a return on its investment, AT&T had ample money to spend” on the abortive waveguide system.
      <p>
      AT&T had attained a government protected monopoly status in the mid-1930s. Like electric utilities, early telecommunications companies were considered to be “natural monopolies”. Early in the history of telephones, customers would sometimes be forced to own two or more phones and pay for multiple services. This is because telephone lines owned by different companies were incompatible; an AT&T subscriber would be unable to call someone using a regional carrier. Thus, customers were naturally attracted to the largest phone company with the most subscribers. Rather than break up the Bell AT&T conglomerate once it attained its natural monopoly, legislators decided to allow it to exist, albeit with increased public oversight, in a corporate form not unlike the electric utilities formed in the 1890s.
      <p>
      AT&T, the holding company for Bell and other subsidiaries, knew that in order to justify its monopoly status, it would need to impress its government patrons. Even though interest in scientific innovation was rampant in the Cold War, far greater than interest had been in Industrial engineer celebrities like Thomas Edison, the Telecom industry failed to capture the popular imagination with their carefully rendered plans. By the time of the Fair, the unchanging Bell Model 500 phone had been present in most American homes for over a decade, so the company could confidently map adoption of the Picturephone, which it predicted would reach mainstream status in several decades.
      <p>
      The Telecom monopoly had come under intense public scrutiny several years earlier, when AT&T brought the manufacturer of the ‘Hush-A-Phone’ to court. The Hush-A-Phone was a plastic attachment that could snap onto a standard issue AT&T podium telephone so that customers could speak in privacy (the less perceptive microphones of the time normally required telephone users to shout). The FCC’s decision to ban this device, resulted in a federal appeals court case which overturned the policy of prohibiting phone services that did not interfere with the telecom’s own network. While the Hush-A-Phone case was perceived as a modest victory for deregulatory forces, the petty nature of the case had seemingly inspired cynicism in the courts that was reflected in a subsequent series of deregulatory decisions. As one appellate Judge on the case complained in response to an FCC argument:
      <p>
      To say that a telephone subscriber may produce the result in question by cupping his hand and speaking into it, but may not do so by using a device which leaves his hand free to write or do whatever else he wishes, is neither just nor reasonable.
      <p>
      The picture phone was only mildly successful in distracting public attention from the crushing bureaucracy that had plagued AT&T’s service for years. Before the first system could be installed, “New York State regulators blocked the new service in Manhattan until the phone company improved its regular service”. Chapter Two notes how Thomas Edison aggressively developed the very first commercial electrical network in downtown Manhattan in order to win the confidence of key institutions, so AT&T’s failure to enter that market was a particularly hard blow.
      <p>
      Of course, the AT&T Picturephone never came to fruition as a commercial product. The company had planned for Picturephone to be key in its future operations, so its ultimate failure was disastrous for both AT&T’s business projections and its internal moral. Several dozen of the devices were installed across the country as novelties in office parks, but they were rarely used. Because AT&T failed to find a high bandwidth system in the waveguide, use of Picturephones turned out to be prohibitively expensive. The AT&T Telephone Pavilion in the 1964 World’s Fair, it turned out, was to remain a fantasy. Nowhere in the exhibit, or in marketing materials used until the late sixties, was it mentioned that the adoption of the devices was dependent more on the development of high bandwidth technology, a field that was largely stagnant.
      <p>
      Rather than a representation of a plausible and imminent future, the pavilion was a corporate ploy designed to distract the public from AT&T’s inadequacy as a monopoly and redirect attention from the spoils of its state sanctioned success. This delusion was not just a facade presented to the public, but one which was taken seriously even by management. Planning 30 years into the future, “The company expected the Picturephone to spread steadily… reaching 100,000 sets in 1975 and a million in 1980…  AT&T expected to be given access to the tremendous cable capacity needed to support the optical waveguides once Picturephones became commonplace, probably after 1990.” These projections were wildly overstated, and the company’s inability to meet them would contribute to its slow demise and the deregulation of the telecom industry.
      <p>
      Although they were often the focal points for public speculation, the displays technology companies created at World’s Fairs presented a skewed vision of reality. World’s Fairs, as historian Robert Rydell argued, have traditionally served as a proving ground for the status of establishment elites. Section Two will discuss how engineers sought to formalize their profession and form an occupational class, much as doctors and lawyers had, so their participation might confirm Rydell’s assessment. In General Electric’s case, the Columbian Exposition presented an opportunity to steal Westinghouse’s thunder, sell municipal power systems of dubious worth, and capitalize on nostalgic misperceptions of Edison’s affiliation with the company.
      <p>
      AT&T’s 1964 pavilion overtly implied that it was a torchbearer of innovation in the space race (an association with overtly patriotic undertones), and that it was on the cusp of a revolution unrivaled since the telephone’s invention. As a company publication exuberantly stated:
      <p>
      Just as the telephone has revolutionized human habits of communicating and made a major contribution to the quality of modern life, many of us at Bell Labs believe that PICTUREPHONE service, the service that lets people see as well as hear each other, offers potential benefits to mankind of the same magnitude.
      <p>
      Of course, the truth was that telephone service had stagnated in the hands of AT&T; once the courts agreed that the Hush-A-Phone was beyond FCC regulation, a host of new aftermarket products like switchboards and handsets emerged. These products used the AT&T network, but were designed and manufactured by small entrepreneurial companies. Their quick ascendance demonstrated the power of competition in AT&T’s previously exclusive market. This would play into a larger narrative about the nature of government regulation in business, especially telecommunications. Just as fiber optic technology became marketable in the late 1970s, the FCC eliminated AT&T’s monopoly on long distance calling, allowing a national high-speed data network to bloom within several years. As Jeffery Hecht explained:
      <p>
      The fiber-optics market took off in the mid-1980s. The deregulation of long-distance telephone service in America created a market for long-distance transmission. MCI, Sprint, and smaller carriers spread tendrils of fiber networks across the country, along railroad lines, gas pipelines, and other rights of way.
      <p>
      These networks would serve as the backbone of the early internet, and their deregulatory origins would inspire the political rhetoric and academic theory around the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to be discussed in Chapter Three. In this sense, part of the origins of the Internet might be traced back to the Hush-A-Phone decision of the late 1950s.
      <p>
      In creating impressive and costly pavilions, large corporations of the Electrical Revolution and the Information Age attempted to validate their self-assumed roles as quasi-public institutions. In order to operate without interference, these companies had to equate themselves with government agencies, both in scale and in competence. The Hush-A-Phone debacle called into question the validity of AT&T’s privileged status and created political strains that the company attempted to ease by investing in grand publicity stunts, and by pushing flamboyantly optimistic rhetoric, like that surrounding the abortive Picturephone.
      <p>
      The maintenance of a corporation’s political mandate would turn out to be nearly as important as its technical competence and products. As one corporate sponsor of the Columbian Exposition put it, the point of massive investment in breathtaking pavilions was “to educate the public regarding the company as an institution”, as a source of public good, rather than the soulless profit seeking machines the public sometimes made them out to be.

        <h1>Part Two</h1>
        <h3>
        <p>
          As previously noted, World’s Fair displays are, by their nature, highly politicized events. However, they are not the only venues in which corporations pitch their comprehensive visions for the future. Another commonality between the rhetoric of the Information Age and the Electrical Revolution is a public obsession with technology’s place in the home. Through both ages, corporations have constructed their image of “the home of the future” both to market existing products and generate hype for their brands. In some cases, these displays were necessary for adoption of new technologies by domestic consumers.
          <p>
          Even by the turn of the 20th century, there was a pervasive misunderstanding of electricity that threatened to slow consumer acceptance. By 1885, “some thought that, like water, electricity obeyed the law of gravity and would flow down unaided but had to be pumped up”, according to David Nye. “Success, said one analyst, required many people to wire their houses, overcome fear of electrocution, discard those whale oil lanterns, and stay up after sundown”. Superstitions ran so high that President Benjamin Harrison was prohibited from touching light switches by his security detail. Clearly, these obstacles were immense, and overcoming them would take great marketing ingenuity.
          <p>
          Resistance to adopting electricity was not just predicated on simple technical ignorance. Arc lamps of years past had occasionally made headlines when improperly installed wires gruesomely electrified hapless line workers. The first execution by electric chair, a device that was hailed as a humanitarian innovation over firing squads or hanging, failed so abysmally that the victim’s heart continued to beat even as his limbs were slowly carbonized by the high voltage. It was thus understandable that some consumers were made apprehensive by the notion of bringing this violent force into their homes.
          <p>
          Similarly, the general public could not be expected to understand the true implications of the Information Age on their everyday lives. Before home computers were economical, computing was an enigma to most, something which scientists and engineers might occasionally depend on, but completely foreign to the average American. Even to people privileged enough to make acquaintance with the technology, computing seemed mysterious and inscrutable. As Information Age historian John Markoff recalls, in the late seventies and early eighties:
          <p>
          Mainstream computing was an exercise in remoteness: You took your problem, captured it in a stack of cards, surrendered it to the priesthood guarding the glass-encased computing machine, and then came back the next day to get the answer on reams of computer-printout paper.
          <p>
          Electricity in the 1890s might have seemed similarly incomprehensible. By then, it was primarily used for municipal and industrial purposes, just as computing in 1990 was still primarily a corporate endeavor. While many large companies had private digital information sharing networks, there were no major consumer applications for the web. However, in both cases, engineers felt a sense of manifest destiny; that their inventions would one day permeate even the most mundane aspects of everyday life.
          <p>
          This inevitably meant that the engineers hoped to bring their creations into the home. To create a sense of immediacy for these plans, large corporations would often create model homes, with every potential benefit of their product, real or imagined, on brilliant display. Predictably, the products on offer would be primarily directed at women, who were often responsible for home purchasing decisions.
          <p>
          By the late 1890s, electrical appliances were of perennial interest to women’s associations and suffrage clubs. Some began to apply the tenants of Fredrick Winslow Taylor’s Scientific Management (discussed further Section Two), seeking to liberate themselves through increased efficiency. Though Scientific Management was written for Industrial managers, its principals were adopted in broader contexts to suit social and political needs. The book basically demonstrated how some factories could be made exponentially more efficient if every worker’s moments were strictly regimented. But Taylorism was reappropiated as a cultural manifesto, that regimentation of social society could be a moral imperative.
          <p>
          The use of home appliances symbiotically fueled a “popular notion that women could formalize homemaking into a legitimate profession, in part by adopting industrial principals like Scientific Management. One article in Lady’s Home Journal, a publication largely responsible for planting that ambition, described how baking a cake could be “Taylorized” through the purchase and careful arrangement of new appliances, reducing the steps it took from 281 to 45.  These obsessively methodic homemaking guides were common in popular women’s magazines of the 1920s. Proponents of this “Domestic Science” envisioned a world where average housewives would require rigorous education in order to hone their craft. Adopting this new industrial discipline would require women, as David Nye recalled, “to study anatomy, chemistry, physiology, hygiene, art, and literature”, such that they could fully realize the opportunities that Domestic Science promised.
          <p>
          It is easy to mistake the early home economics movement as a form of self-empowerment for the repressed domestic housewife. This assumption comes intuitively; with all the time and exhaustion saved now that the washboard was obsolete and once time consuming tasks automated, wouldn’t average women inevitably achieve some degree of previously unknown independence? Sadly, this opportunity was ignored by the early home economics movement.
          <p>
          Rather than challenging the domestic role of women, the technologies of the home of the future promised only to further embed women in home life. This is because the mechanization  played into the growing school of “home economics” that cast “the home as a management site controlled by women who, through the use of applied science, would free themselves from drudgery and raise the quality of family life.” In other words, the ambition of the rhetoric behind the home of the future was never gender equality, but rather to make women more effective wives and mothers.
          <p>
          The fact that most early innovations focused on the kitchen was telling of women’s role in the electrification of America. One of the first displays of the electrified home took place at the Columbian Exposition. Although it would be decades before the average home was equipped to use them, one display featured “electric stoves and hot plates, saucepans, water heaters, washing and ironing machines, dishwashers, fans, and carpet sweepers.” The vision of a resurrection of the Victorian ideal of the poised domestic women embracing modern technology continued as a theme in marketing the future. In 1905, still decades before electric household appliances became common, one GE marketing demonstration showed a woman in a formal Victorian dress operating an early hot plate.
          <p>
          By 1922, when electrical appliances had finally become feasible for millions of homes which were already electrified for light, hundreds of demonstration homes were built by local utilities, hoping to increase electricity billings by encouraging the sale of more household appliances. Usually the homes would operate as show places where potential customers could test new gadgets and contract installation. After several weeks, they would normally be dismantled as showrooms and sold. These exhibits were generally successful, and they had exactly the effect that home economists had expected. The result was not to liberate women, but to further confine them in the home. As David Nye explained:
          <p>
          Long work hours in the home persisted as a result of raising expectations for middle class women, who were exhorted to prepare more varied meals, vacuum the house more often, maintain a larger wardrobe, do laundry more frequently, and spend more time with the children.
          <p>
          While the onerous and time consuming work of washing linens by hand and pumping and carrying water was often eliminated, women were not thus afforded the luxury of independence. Saddled with a host of new domestic responsibilities, the adoption of home appliances was not generally rewarded with increased leisure time or the pursuit of non-wifely duties. 1920’s advertisements articulated this with acuity. One proclaimed, “A man’s castle is a woman’s factory”.
          <p>
          From a modern lens, it is easy to castigate the portrayal of the electrified home of the future as a missed opportunity for women. But back then the home economics revolution was seen by progressives as a cause not far out of line with the feminist movement. The modern industrial woman was, to some extent, elevated to the role of a “manager”, using the home “factory” to “produce” healthy citizens. Thomas Edison, in an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine would cast the new role of the modern woman as “rather a domestic engineer than a domestic laborer.” By equating the domestic work of women with the industrial work of men, the home economics movement sought to frame women as active participants and benefactors of the industrial revolution, and, as section three will note, to elevate women to a higher degree of citizenship.

          <p>
          Manifestations of the home of the future have continued to be a rich source of public fascination and marketing ingenuity. As early as 1966, it had been appropriated to market the coming computer aided Information Revolution. This is when a Westinghouse engineer installed an 800-pound computer in his basement using excess parts he found on the job. Wires ran to binary displays and teletypes near every door, the living room, and the kitchen. The company soon heard about this novelty and started marketing the house and family in a series of newspaper articles. The engineer had rigged the device to store his wife’s recipes and make shopping lists, and he also had plans to have it track her grocery inventory.
          <p>
          The ambitious home computer, and other abortive attempts to introduce digital technology to the kitchen in the sixties, harkened directly back to the home economics movement. As Ted Friedman noted in his book, Electric Dreams:
          <p>
          They were a logical attempt to model the home computer along the lines of most of the new machines successfully marketed to American families in the twentieth century: “labor-saving” household appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers, and refrigerators.
          <p>
          However, now engineers hoped to draw domestic women into the Information Age rather than the industrial one. In the early sixties, when books like The Feminine Mystique highlighted the increasingly formulaic roles of middle class men and women, this vision of the future of the digital revolution as an extension of the electric one was predictable. But the Information Age did not leave its mark on the household for several decades, and has yet to embed itself in normal home appliances and fixtures.
          <p>
          By the late 1990’s, many of the tenets of Home Economics, that women could rise to the level of her husband through domestic management, for example, seemed archaic if not downright sexist. But the rhetoric around marketing new domestic technology had not changed. One Microsoft video imagining an imminent home of the future depicted a housewife using a kitchen counter mounted computer to make shopping lists, keep track of ingredients, and read recipes. She is also able to control other aspects of the house, like the TV and air conditioning from a “home office”, a relatively new term that would have been music to the ears of proponents of “Domestic Science”. Now, like a factory, the home would also have an office from which women could manage the cultivation of their children and home lives. In the video, the wife’s husband does take a macho supporting role managing the digital household; he activates the security system from the “web phone” on his bedside table before he goes to sleep.
          <p>
          In this case too, the fundamental purpose of new home technology was not to create leisure time for the inhabitants of the home of the future. Instead, the family continues to operate just as it had before, only more efficiently. The wife still cooks, the husband still works 9 to 5, the children still watch television, and the nuclear family continues, just as it did before. The promise of the home of the future was never to subvert the family structure and allow alternate lifestyles for women or otherwise. Instead, the home of the future has traditionally served to show how technology could be used to embed the most traditional societal norms into the very walls of the home.

          <h2>Media and Advertising</h2>
          <h1>Part Three</h1>
          <h3>
              <p>
              If the implicit assertions that corporations made in public venues like World’s Fairs and Homes of the Future were premature, they would seem mild compared to those made many of the advertisements that accompanied them. Widely disseminated copy would frame these corporations not as profit-seeking appendages of billion heir’s and robber-barons, but benevolent leviathans, advancing a humanitarian cause. Advertisements angled to enshroud their subjects with an air of patriotic ascendancy, dubiously framing electrical companies as the instigators  of political achievements and technological breakthroughs.
              <p>
              In one advertisement run in 1923 General Electric celebrated its role in enabling the woman’s suffrage movement. Entitled “The Suffrage and the Switch”, it depicted a woman turning on a light superimposed behind a woman’s gloved hand submitting a ballot. The copy read:
              <p>
              Millions of American women voted for president in 1920 and are finding the time to take active interest in civic affairs. Woman suffrage made the American woman the political equal of her man. The little switch which commands the great servant Electricity is making her workshop the equal of her man’s.
              <p>
              Note how the advertisement did not just implicitly claim that GE made possible woman’s suffrage through labor saved. Instead, through her the mastery of the “servant Electricity”, the American woman had elevated herself worthiness of the vote. This would square with Edison’s social Darwinist tendency, as David Nye recalled, “He believed that appliances in the home would literally force the housewife’s brain and nervous system to evolve to be the ‘equal’ of her husband’s.” To modern ears, this assertion might seem ignorant or even crass, but compared to claims made in other corporate copy, responsibility for woman’s suffrage would seem a modest exaggeration.
              <p>
              Future advertisements would be even more aggressive in their assertions of social good. At a 1939 General Electric demonstration, a presenter would articulate a corporate tactic that had come to characterize electrical advertising:
              <p>
              General Electric, as one of the leading scientific organizations of the world, recognizes its responsibility to promote progress-constantly to produce new comforts and conveniences; to raise the living standards of everyone; to make this world a better place to live… It is to this service for humanity that General Electric is dedicated.
              <p>
              To endeavor to make the world a better place to live for humanity is certainly an ambitious corporate goal, and arguably one that General Electric could creditably to have strived to accomplish. But if it had done so, it was through the production and sale of consumer products to what was at that point still a relatively privileged class of urban professionals. GE would emphasize its farming innovations, but as David Nye noted “simply ignored the blight of actual farmers, and made no effort to explain their relation to the landless migrants described in The Grapes of Wrath”. What worth were these fantastic new inventions to a constituency of farmers who had no access to electricity and no means of getting it, like 90 percent of farmers in 1930?
              <p>
              In fact, General Electric and the broader electricity industry had long been deeply embedded in many of the issues of heated public controversy; the rise of the industrial robber baron and the concentration of wealth in the 1880s and 1890s, the vast system of patronage and excess in the 1920s, and the decline of rural America in the 1930s, to name a few. Yet by affiliating themselves with their more illusory connection with the betterment of the human condition, they were able to save face and avert public enmity. As large electrical conglomerates came to resemble public trusts, rather than private institutions, maintaining broad support among the populace became increasingly important to General Electric and other companies leading this transition.
              <p>
              Often the claims made by the electric industry verged on the ludicrous. When the federal government pushed for greater development of public power in the sixties, “privately owned” utilities ran a vicious campaign to erode support for such a move. One ad depicted an armed guard stopping an elderly couple at the Berlin Wall. “Freedom is Not Lost by Guns Alone, when government owns business, it can control both goods and jobs… Then freedom has quietly slipped away. A quiet threat can be the deadliest. You may not know it is there until it is too late”, the ad ominously warned. Chapter two will discuss the rise of the electric utility as the ultimate realization to the quasi-public institution.
              <p>
              This ad would reflect a long tradition of cloaking private electrical trusts with the American flag in a perpetual effort to consolidate public support (further discussed in Chapter Two). The audience of the campaign would be forgiven for forgetting that private utilities are deeply embedded at every level of anticompetitive government complicity; they were guaranteed profit regardless of waste, granted a legislatively enforced monopoly, and could hardly claim the grounds from which to champion free markets. This campaign, however, was successful, driving support for public power from 30 to 70 percent in the 1960s.
              <p>
              But identifying with broad national causes to their own advantage was not the most aggressive tactic industry advertising would pursue. Another strategy which GE utilized with precision was to subtlety equate the work of electrical companies with the humanitarian “world’s work”. “ACHIEVEMENT”, one 1910s ad proudly proclaimed, superimposed against an imagined corporate utopian legacy- an image of a vast industrial metropolis of towering skyscrapers, generating plants, transmission lines, train cars, workers and engineers relentlessly managing it all. Above the cacophony of industrial activity, a massive GE monogram replaced the sun. Some of the copy read, “By the achievements which this company as already recorded may best be judged the greater ends its future shall attain.”
              <p>
              Another campaign from the period advertised an improved light bulb that was superimposed in front of an image of the earth and sun. The catch phrase: “His only rival”. Although the “his” in the ad referred to a personification of the sun, it is hard not to imagine that GE was casting itself as the arbiter of a force rivaled only by God. Another ad from the period was even more overt. It reproduced an 1816 argument against street lighting, apparently highlighting the absurdity of not purchasing GE products: “Artificial lighting is an attempt to interfere with the divine plan which has preordained darkness during the nighttime.”
              <p>
              <center>•</center>
              <p>
              In the dramatic rise of the Information Age in the past two decades, the claims made in corporate advertising were no less incredible. The competing rhetoric glorifying companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have become so intense that social commentators regularly skewer the companies for playing up their humanitarian roles such that their corporate roles are eclipsed. Commenting on a scene in which inventor entrepreneurs at a startup competition successively declare their innovation’s ability “to make the world a better place,” the director of the recent sit-com Silicon Valley, Mike Judge noted:
              <p>
              There seems to be this obligatory thing that (Information Age companies) have to throw in there... I mean, there are some people are making the world a better place, some maybe aren't, but it's just funny that most of it, it's just capitalism.
              <p>
              Many corporations adopt aspirational slogans that they use outwardly to project their roles as corporate stewards of humanity. Google famously adopted the term “Don’t be Evil,” which turned out to be a potent philosophy among its employees and users alike. “There is a shared, and perhaps blinding, belief on the Google campus that Google was altruistic, an attitude reflected in ‘Don’t be evil’”.
              <p>
              This slogan persevered even through Google’s IPO, normally a time of ideological moderation as companies court investors and submit to a battery of new regulation. In the midst of an boilerplate SEC disclosure, the founders placed an “Owner’s Manual” for Google’s share holders, including subheadings “Don’t Be Evil” and “Making the World a Better Place”, which cast it’s advertising and e-mail programs as tools to “bridge the digital divide” by connecting consumers and producers; advertisers and their targets.
              <p>
              One television ad Google recently aired depicted the grandchildren of two elderly men, divided for decades by the Indian-Pakistan Partition. The two technologically savvy children use a host of Google products to rekindle their grandparent’s friendships. Compared to the celestial terms in which GE portrayed itself, the Google ad was relatively modest, and even plausible.
              <p>
              Yet Google and other information technology companies will inevitably become tangled in the contentious social, economic, and political issues which history books will one day judge us by. Google, for instance, played its part promoting the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s. Its IPO created hundreds of millionaires, and it is widely held to account for promoting social stratification and gentrification in the San Francisco area. For example, in the past two years, frustrated protestors have taken to blocking and vandalizing buses contracted to shuttle employees to Silicon Valley. Google has also been accused of brash and legally grey competitive techniques, such as offering news aggregation services without the permission of the sites it indexed. In other words, despite the humanitarian and altruistic shroud, Google faces the same conflicts as many of its competitors.
              <p>
              While many technology companies cast themselves and their products in a similar humanitarian light, the only one that can match General Electric’s rhetorical prowess is Apple Computer. In one of the most renowned television ads of the century, Apple hired the acclaimed director Ridley Scott to film the commercial known as “1984”. In it, a lone female athlete, adorned in an Apple branded tank top, runs through a dystopian metropolis, uniformed men marching in unison, watching a close up of “Big Brother” angrily gushing inscrutable propaganda. The woman, clearly a human embodiment of the company, hurls a sledgehammer into the screen creating an awesome explosion. A solemn voice is heard: “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce the Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like 1984.”
              <p>
              This commercial is important for two reasons. The first is that it announced a truly revolutionary product, the first mouse equipped point and click interface. But the format of the ad was equally noteworthy. As Ted Friedman pointed out:
              <p>
              The schema of the “1984” ad allowed Apple to harness the visual fascination of a high-tech future behind it, it became a touch-stone for the dot-com hype of the 1990s, anchoring the images of technology corporations.
              <p>
              In other words, the 1984 ad gave technology companies the vocabulary with which they could claim their legacy as the new arbiters, and in this case, even the protectors of the American spirit of innovation and social progress. This would influence the rhetoric around the entire technology industry for the following decades.
              <p>
              Apple did not stop at marketing itself as a lone hero averting a dystopian future, it also depicted itself as the heir to a rich tradition of innovation, craftsmanship, civil disobedience, and basically anything and anyone one inspiring. In the ad “Here’s to the crazy ones”, a wistful narrator celebrates “the round pegs in square holes”:
              <p>
              They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
              <p>
              Meanwhile, black and white film of historical American counterculture icons like Martin Luther King, Bob Dylan, and Thomas Edison stoically cut into one another. Finally, an Apple logo and its slogan “Think Different” appear on the screen.
              <p>
              Before “1984”, technology companies had been oddly coy about advertising their products, and never attempted to equate themselves with past historical figures, as GE had done with its ostensible founder. As Ted Friedman noted, until then, computers were seen as cold and foreboding; stigmatized by Darth Vader, Hal 2000, and Star Trek. Some companies responded with topical and hokey ads, like IBM, who ironically appropriated Charlie Chaplin’s technology adverse Modern Times to market its products. “Rewriting the story of the dystopian Modern Times to give it a Desk Set–style happy ending was an act of astounding gall, but judging from the IBM PC sales, it was quite successful.”, says Friedman
              <p>
              Like the electricity industry before it, the information and computing industry now had the vocabulary it needed to establish the foundation of a new era. Computer companies began to realize that in order to justify their growing influence and stature, they would need to be more than just competent at their technical craft. Like electrical companies before them, they would need to adopt a corporate persona and grow to more resemble public institutions. Some of the mechanics and implications of this are discussed in Chapter Three.

            <a name="NeoJeffersonianDreams"></a>
            <h2>Neo-Jeffersonian Dreams</h2>
            <h1>Part Four</h1>
            <h3>
            At the dawn of both the Electrical Revolution and the Information Age, rampant speculation abounded on how new technologies would affect the rural areas. Politicians and social commentators often predicted that advances in technology would result in a resurrection of the declining Jeffersonian ideal; newly empowered people in rural and farming communities would leverage technology to reestablish economic and cultural primacy, as they had in the early years of the country’s founding.
            <p>
            By 1930, rural areas had experienced a dramatic depopulation, and farming communities had fallen victim to economic stagnation, especially compared with the growing political capital being accumulated in urban areas. As Gifford Pinchot, a well known political and conservation spokesman of the time noted:
            <p>
            “Only electric service can put the farmer on an equality with the townsmen and preserve the farm as the nursery of men and leaders of men that it has been in the past”.
            <p>
            Even from the invention of very first domestic and agricultural applications of electrical currents, engineers and politicians were acutely aware of the drudgery their technologies might avert. According to his rather self-aggrandizing autobiography, Nikola Tesla was one of the first to realize the potential of electricity to vastly improve the quality of life for the laboring class. Immediately upon imagining how an electric motor might work, the potential benefits might create, he dreamed that it would be used ubiquitously: “No more will men be slaves to hard tasks. My motor will set them free, it will do the work of the world.”
            <p>
            In fact, even before electricity was widely available, engineers developed an abundance of applications. In 1913, General Electric published a fully illustrated, 66 page catalogue of available farm equipment, including corn huskers, vacuum milkers, and even ozonators for improved mushroom growth. Yet two long decades later, only 1 in 9 farms were equipped to take advantage of those technologies.
            <p>
            The labor saving aspect of electrification was only one driver of the optimism around rural cooperatives. Evidence also indicated that many early efforts to electrify were meant to combat the cultural decline that many rural communities experienced in the early twentieth century. By the early 1930s, most city dwellings were electrified while only a small minority of rural towns had even basic service. The stratifying effect of this discrepancy was overt; one 1931 cartoon showed a couple considering the purchase of a country dwelling, only to be put off by the lack of electrical service. “Without electricity we would have to use kerosene lamps”, the wife scornfully explained, “Think of the bother of trying to get ice”.
            <p>
            In essence, America had been divided into two nations, one that took electricity for granted and could laugh at the backward ways of those without it, and one where the ubiquitous signs of urban modernity were completely absent. The contrast was stark enough to make each nation so alien to the other that their living conditions became fundamentally incompatible, as the cartoon humorously demonstrated.
            <p>
            Weary of the archaic stigma that the lack of electrification conferred on them, many small towns apparently first opted to electrify not for economical benefits, but instead to boost their own social status. Envious of the mystical “Great White Way” in New York, several small towns through the twenties, like Nyack, New York and Bellefontaine, Ohio financed their own miniature equivalents.  This vain tradition was chronicled in Sinclair Lewis’s Main Street. Upon the illumination of Gopher Prairie’s main thoroughfare, a local speaker declared, “Now the point of this is: I’m not only insisting Gopher Prairie is going to be Minnesota’s pride, the brightest ray in the glory of the north star state, but further more that it is right now.”
            <p>
            This made for potent rhetoric during the rural electrification movement of the 1930s. Local politicians would often foment popular support by claiming credit for federally enacted electrification programs. The Rural Electrification Agency, for example, encouraged the creation of cooperative utilities by offering ultra low interest loans and logistical support to towns that volunteered to build them. “Rural Electrification was popular among congressmen, for they could easily present themselves as the initiators of REA services in their districts”, according to historian D. Clayton Brown:
            <p>
            They espoused the Jeffersonian ideal of agrarian values, seeking electrification as a means of restoring rural life and replenishing, so to speak, the nursery stock of American leaders and source of democratic values.
            <p>
            The effect of the program immediately stimulated community building and camaraderie, as farmers and other natives came together to facilitate cooperative construction and management. “In the early years, (cooperative) business meetings had been akin to church socials or harvest festivals”, according to one REA participant.  There was a sense that country citizens would genuinely be able to better themselves through technology, and evidence exists to substantiate that impression; the ability to read at night, for example, helped the Muncie library multiply it’s lending nine times from 1890 to 1925.
            <p>
            Thus, “by the 1920s the rural use of electricity was no longer thought of as a luxury, but as a technological advancement necessary to fulfill the promise of American life”. In other words, the drive to electrify was motivated just as much by a desire to attain the full advantages of citizenship that people in urban areas had as it was by the economic benefits electrification could bring farmers.
            <p>
            <center>•</center>
            <p>
            More than half a century later, politicians and commentators would once again predict that the adoption of new technologies could facilitate a resurrection of Jeffersonian ideals and a resurgence in the primacy of rural areas. By the mid-nineties, it was widely speculated that technologies like e-mail and video conferencing would allow future workers to “telecommute” from home, which they hoped might reduce the relevance of large cities in the execution of white collar work. Further, they hoped that more widely disseminated and accessible information would level the intellectual divide between urban and rural areas.
            <p>
            Bill Clinton articulated these hopes in the 1996 signing ceremony of the Telecommunication Act, which was self consciously performed in the Jefferson wing of the Library of Congress.
            <p>
            Most of you know Jefferson deeded his books to the Library… Today the information revolution is spreading light, the light Jefferson spoke about, all across our land and across the world. It will allow every American child to bring the ideas stored in this reading room into his or her own living room.
            <p>
            One important aspect of the Telecommunications Act was that it required subsidization for new Internet connections for some schools and libraries. Just as electric light gave the children of Muncie (and presumably other parts of the world) more time to read loaned books in the 1920s, Clinton predicted that the educational benefits of widely disseminated information would ultimately aid in a better informed and more active rural citizenry.
            <p>
            The people in rural areas did not just hope to improve educational opportunities with Information Age tools. Some communities hoped that aggressive adoption of new technologies would reverse the tides of the urban migration that by then had conspicuously eroded the populations of some rural towns.
            <p>
            One Microsoft ad attempted to cash in on this bootstrapping mentality. Entitled “Anthem”, the ad cuts from shot to shot of Rockwellian small town utopia in the small town of Lusk, Wyoming; a police officer washing his cruiser, smiling children outfitted in cowboy hats at a rodeo, and so on. A somber voice pontificates on the newly connected towns ingenuity:
            <p>
            The schools have 320 computers for 500 kids. Home businesses are common. Why? They’re practical people. They want to talk to the outside world using technology. They wanna save their ranches with technology. They want to talk to the kids who have left and keep more kids from leaving by having the technology. They want to save their small town and keep it exactly the way it is”
            <p>
            It is hard not to draw parallels between Microsoft’s portrayal of Lusk, Wyoming and Sinclair Lewis’s depiction Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. Both in the Information Age and the Electrical Revolution, nostalgic boosters would speculate that technology could help restore small towns to their former prominence. Both communities cast the use of technology not as an overture into a progressive future, but as a retreat back to traditional values in order to resurrect a faded glory. Just as Gopher Prairie was the self-proclaimed “brightest star in Minnesota” even before electrification, Lusk would both save itself and stay “exactly the way it is”.
            <p>
            This has a certain parity with the previously discussed “home economics” moment, which also commandeered new technology to help embed traditions of the past into a technologically and socially “progressive” future.
            <p>
            Hopes of the resurrection of rural communities through information technology were not only predicated on the bootstrapping betterment of current residents. Many thought that the internet would allow telecommuting white collar workers to abscond from their dreary city lives and relocate to the vibrant countryside.
            <p>
            The 1970s saw a “back to the land” movement in which many affluent city dwellers would purchase second homes and retire to rural regions. Starting in the early 1990s, many commentators predicted that the Internet would facilitate a resurgence of that trend. Bruce R. Hull, an environmental advocate at University of Chicago, exuberantly put it this way:
            <p>
            The cultural currents of Jeffersonian pastoralism continue to thrive as a wave of “neo” pastoralists trade the business suit blues for their blue-jean dreams… Technologies such as telecommuting, flexible work hours, and the information superhighway fuel the counterculture urban to rural migration.
            <p>
            Hull observed a niche trend in which tech savvy urban professionals used the Internet to free themselves from geographic constraints, abandoning congested cities for what he presumably saw as the more desirable rural country side, not just because there was an economic incentive to do so, but because of the superior moral fiber of rural areas.
            <p>
            At the very dawn of the home computer, Alvin Toffler wrote a utopian novel predicting that a new “electronic cottage” would replace the office, resulting in every splendor a neo-Jeffersonian could hope for: greater community stability, a renaissance among volunteer organizations, the decentralization of industry, and the resurgence of the family unit.
            <p>
            <center>•</center>
            <p>
            So far, the results of both the Electrical Revolution and the Information Age have run counter to the predictions of most Jeffersonian hopefuls. Electrification failed to slow urban migration and arguably enhanced the allure of city life to rural households. The advent of the radio, one of the most prolifically adopted innovations of early electrification, audibly illustrated city temptations, as Clayton Brown put it:
            <p>
            In heightening the awareness of the cultural differences, radio encouraged youth to acquire a more sophisticated mode of life, and they flocked to the cities in search of satisfaction. In this sense the new instrument intensified migration to the city, the antithesis of what the early proponents of electrification had hoped would happen.

            This is not to say that electrification was a failure; it vastly enhanced the quality of life for many American’s living in the country. However it did not succeed in “boosting” small towns to prominence or stopping the erosion of the rural farming populace once it was finally achieved. Instead, farms became vastly more productive, employing far fewer people. This was a result that many commentators might have found counter-intuitive. As David Nye put it, “Successful rural electrification both improved farm life and helped to depopulate the farms… as productivity soared, thousands of farmers left for other kinds of work.”

            A single family could only cultivate several acres of land without electricity, but by using tools that were widely available in the 1930s, one family could manage a farm with over 40 acres. Unlike the “home of the future” which helped to embed traditional values into new technology, the rural farm of the future was something completely new. Farmers had no choice but to live fundamentally altered life styles predicated around the efficient adoption of new technology. The ultimate effect was not a revival of an older order but entry into a new one.

            While rural cooperatives yielded enhanced community relations at first, the effect quickly faded. The festive environment that the REA participant described soon lost its luster, and cooperatives became drab faceless entities, not much different from a private utility. “With the decline of farm membership and the rise of suburban areas within its jurisdiction”, the participant recounted, “The cooperative lost much of this spirit and became to most of its members just ‘the electric company’.”

            Similarly, many observers have been disappointed by the Information Age’s failure to revive stagnating communities like Lusk. Walter Isaacson recently observed that, “Among the myths of the Digital Age is that we would all be able to telecommute and collaborate electronically. Instead, the greatest innovations have come from people gathered in the flesh, on beanbag chairs rather than in chat rooms”.

            Although a small counterculture may exist of people who use new technology to escape cities, no mainstream migration to rural areas has created a transformation in American life. This is not to say that the ubiquity telecommuting was an incorrect prediction. Instead, as many have observed that, in addition to a steady job, many Americans telecommute back to work upon arrival at home. Slate Magazine, a journal of note in the Information Age, put it this way:
            <p>
            Telecommuters, the majority of whom still go to the office, even if less frequently than their non-telecommuting peers—are in some sort of Catch-22 here: They want to use technology to become more productive and spend more time with their families, but the availability of productivity-boosting technology also makes their managers believe that the employees will get more work done, on weekends or after dinner… Somehow, what was supposed to be an “electronic cottage” has become an “electronic sweatshop.”
            <p>
            Rather than living more holistic family focused lives in rural areas, many American workers find that the advent of telecommuting further embeds them in the working world, even at times traditionally reserved for domestic family life. One Pew survey found that, as a result of networked telecommuting, “working Americans have become more likely to check their work-related email on weekends, on vacation and before and after they go to work for the day.”

            The emergence of Neo-Jeffersonians seeking to capture the benefit of electricity for their own ideological cause is typical of the rhetoric that transformative new technologies invite. Although ideologically shaded predictions of future use of technology influence pubic hopes and understanding, they are often erroneous, informed more by narrow political interests than by a comprehensive understanding of technology. As this chapter has discussed, corporations, feminists, and politicians have all been guilty of disseminating such rhetoric.
